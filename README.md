# Brackets and Ladders
SEP G04 Assignment

Besides using standard Meteor and React, ReactDOM packages, this application uses:
- Kadira: flow-router (https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router)
- Kadira: react-mounter (https://github.com/kadirahq/react-mounter)
- Kadira: dochead (https://github.com/kadirahq/meteor-dochead)
- Semantic-ui (http://semantic-ui.com/)
Feel free to explore those packages to learn what they do. An example of Kadira in action is within the ```/index.js``` file. An example of a Semantic-ui template in use is in the ```/generic/NavBar.js``` file
